This mod adds a bunch of items and blocks\
to your game that are all very funny and will make\
you laugh a lot.

## Why?!
Why not? Is there any side effects of laughing?\
But seriously, I made this mod because I wanted to\
make a mod that is just for fun.

## Adds...

- Hammer!\
  To use it, right-click it to mine all blocks in a 6x6x6 area.

- Propeller Hat!\
  A hat that gives you fly hacks.
- Slippers!\
  A pair of slippers, when you hit a mob with them, it will\
  be knocked back with knock back 55. Cannot be crafted as it\
  is too powerful.

  The block gives you poison I if it is raining.
